This is the source code underlying the post [Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/). I explained it in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jonaslindeloev/status/1110907133833502721).

This is the main content:

 * **index.Rmd** is the Rmarkdown code which generated the post.
 * **linear_tests_cheat_sheet.odt** is a Libreoffice Writer document with the cheat sheet.
 * The other **.Rmd** files are the simulations of the accuracy of the parametric approximation to non-parametric tests.
